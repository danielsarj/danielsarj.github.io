Hello! My name is Daniel Araujo, and I am a biologist whose research interest lies in understanding the genetic architecture of human traits. 

I am originally from Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. During my undergrad, I joined a microbiology lab and got involved in research in genetics and bioinformatics. After graduation, I moved to Chicago, USA, to pursue a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at Loyola University Chicago. In my masters, I became deeply interested in quantitative genetics. Nowadays, I am a Human Genetics Ph.D. candidate at the University of Chicago, under the supervision of Dr. Luis Barreiro. 

I enjoy spending my free time reading crime/thriller books, doing jigsaw puzzles, taking care of my plants, and sitting by Lake Michigan (when the weather is nice ðŸ˜¬).
