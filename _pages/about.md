Hello! My name is Daniel Araujo, and I am a biologist whose research interest lies in understanding the relationship between genetic variants, gene expression, and complex traits. 

I am originally from Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. During my undergrad, I joined a microbiology lab and got involved in research in genetics and bioinformatics. After graduation, I moved to Chicago, USA, to pursue a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at Loyola University Chicago. In my master's, I became deeply interested in human population genetics. Nowadays, I am a 1st-year Human Genetics Ph.D. student at the University of Chicago. 

I enjoy spending my free time reading crime/thriller books, doing jigsaw puzzles, playing video games, and going for walks by Lake Michigan (when the weather is nice ðŸ˜¬).
